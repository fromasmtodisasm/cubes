WOULD BE NICE

    -----------------------------------------

    Implement small adjustments, eg. speed up n frames over x seconds, slow down etc.

    This should be only small adjustments.

    If detect that desync has occured outside of threshold for small adjustments,
    go back to synchronize state.

    Make sure that when going back to snychronize the sync offset is cleared to zero.

    -----------------------------------------

    Implement interpolation between ticks for client render, eg. fix your timestep.

    -----------------------------------------

    Might be a good idea to create server guid and stick it in connecting packets,
    as well as sync packets, this way the client cannot connect or get packets sent
    to it for long without knowing the challenge response.

    -----------------------------------------

    Get the alpha blending and color transition blending working again.

    To do this we'll need the concept of per-entity view data, eg. indexed by entity id.

    Move the client window setup and create stuff into render.cpp

    Remove the vector BS in physics_ode.cpp for the authority walk. Come up with a better data structure.

    physics_ode.cpp uses a bunch of C++ vector classes for authority walk. Can probably do better than this.

    Would be very nice to be able to connect by hostname. 

    If the address to connect to does not resolve to a valid address, try running it through DNS.

    Ideally this could be done seamlessly inside client state machine

    Ideally the DNS resolution would be non-blocking
