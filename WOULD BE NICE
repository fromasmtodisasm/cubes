WOULD BE NICE

    Get the alpha blending and color transition blending working again.

    To do this we'll need the concept of per-entity view data, eg. indexed by entity id.

    Move the client window setup and create stuff into render.cpp

    Remove the vector BS in physics_ode.cpp for the authority walk. Come up with a better data structure.

    physics_ode.cpp uses a bunch of C++ vector classes for authority walk. Can probably do better than this.
