Seems like to get the cube to have a proper amount of push out of a katamari ball, it seems necessary to count the number
of cubes that are in the katamari ball and get an estimate of mass. Then the force can be multiplied by this mass.

This is also a cool mechanic if the ball needs a way to collect cubes, and then can use these cubes to jump higher. Neat.

There is a small bug with the shadow casting. Probably a wrong dot product for a certain orientation of a cube face?
