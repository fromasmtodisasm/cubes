Cube bounces up too high initially. 

If the force is a function of both height, and velocity, eg. it ramps down as the 
cube gets vertical velocity up, then it should be possible to get it to work both
when the cubes are in a katamari ball, and floating around normal without going
too high in either situation.

There is a small bug with the shadow casting. Probably a wrong dot product for a certain orientation of a cube face?
