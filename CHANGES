    Initial commit.

    Move constants into const.h

    Bring across protocol.h from compression demo

    Split out snapshot stuff from protocol.h

    Add constants to const.h for tick rate (240), server frame rate (30), client frame rate (60)

    Need to get an actual high precision timer for the server. I'm sure I have old code around there for this

    Bring across stuff for timers, sleep and so on (platform.h)

    Sketch out server loop with time and sleeps etc. Working fine.

    Sketched out a good server loop that measures jitter caused by sleep and works with it.

    Added code to detect dropped frames.

    Added safety code so that at least 50% of frame time is required to sim frame otherwise another frame is dropped.
