GOAL

Get the existing cube demo working but with one display and pure client/server architecture

Set this up so the server can run on an EC2 instance

Implement proper interpolation buffer and aim ahead for frame n jitter buffer

Work out how client speeds up vs. slows down time. Tricky without artifacts or adding latency.

Adjust this architecture such that client side prediction is implemented
