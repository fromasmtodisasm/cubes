TODO:    

    Bring back player cube linear bobbing. Retune it.

    Bring back player cube angular bobbing. Retune it.

    Bring back player cube rotation to face the current direction of movement (eg. anticipation/work)

    Bring back the player stay upright torque. Retune it.

    ------------------------------

    Bring across authority colors and alpha blending (in a general way such that all objects can have authority)

    ------------------------------

    Update the cube player cube so that it works on a per-cube basis, or maybe even a per-physics object basis?

    ------------------------------

    Remove the simulation from the client and run it in the server

    Bring in enough networking to send packets between client and server (network.h)

    Send input across to server, using redundancy encoding for lost commands (eg. acks)

    Setup response packet from server -> client containing snapshot.

    Goal is to setup a pure client/server system (with latency here) before implementing client side prediction.

    Take time to get the jitter buffer for inputs and interpolation buffer working before going further.
