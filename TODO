DONE:

    Removed linux MOTD. Annoying.

    Get the non-headless client working and connect it to the server.

    Seems that the server gets into modes where the client drops inputs.

    I'm not sure if this is bursts of packet loss or the client being legitimately behind.

    If I set the client to run 16 ticks ahead of the server (safety) this would let me know
    if it is dropped packets or if the client is just late (due to packet loss or otherwise).

    Client still seems to be dropping a lot of inputs even at 16.

    I suspect the dropped inputs are not the network but are an error with the adjustment of client tick.

    Or they could be something caused by the non-headless client.

    Try with headless client. Does the same thing happen?

    It doesn't seem to. Not exactly making 60fps on client?

TODO:

    Get the server sending back uncompressed position, orientation, linear, angular velocity
    for the one cube. I can verify that at least the client inputs are being sent across to server
    and being received, and then I can interpolate the position of the client

    ----------------------------------------










    ----------------------------------------

    Bring across interpolation delay.

    Implement snapshot packets sent to client.

    Bring across delta encoding stuff from snapshots and interpolation demo.

    -----------------------------------------

    At this point should have pure client/server implementation with RTT baked in.

    Try running this over the internet to the real server instance running on linux.

    Are small adjustments required to get it to work? 

    Probably... but make sure.
