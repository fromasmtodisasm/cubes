DONE:

TODO:    

    -----------------------------------------

    Extend client to adjust client tick at point that synchronization ends
    to server tick plus offset, and start sending inputs to server.

    Implement sliding window of inputs in client.

    Start encoding inputs up to maximum input

    Verify that server receives inputs (print them out with tick)

    -----------------------------------------

    Bring across interpolation delay.

    Implement snapshot packets sent to client.

    Bring across delta encoding stuff from snapshots and interpolation demo.

    -----------------------------------------

    At this point should have pure client/server implementation with RTT baked in.

    Try running this over the internet to the real server instance running on linux.

    Are small adjustments required to get it to work? Probably... but make sure.
