DONE:

TODO:

    There is some fluctuation on the linux box.

    Instead of measuring minimum delivering for adjustments, take the average
    then calculate one, two standard deviations of delivery.

    If the standard deviation of delivery is within +/- 4 tolerance of average.

    This should avoid the client fluctuating speed faster/slower for no reason.

    Need to study a bit of statistics to understand exactly what I want to do here.











    ----------------------------------------

    Bring across interpolation delay.

    Implement snapshot packets sent to client.

    Bring across delta encoding stuff from snapshots and interpolation demo.

    -----------------------------------------

    At this point should have pure client/server implementation with RTT baked in.

    Try running this over the internet to the real server instance running on linux.

    Are small adjustments required to get it to work? 

    Probably... but make sure.
