DONE:

TODO:

    ----------------------------------------

    Bring across interpolation delay.

    Implement snapshot packets sent to client.

    Bring across delta encoding stuff from snapshots and interpolation demo.

    -----------------------------------------

    At this point should have pure client/server implementation with RTT baked in.

    Try running this over the internet to the real server instance running on linux.

    Are small adjustments required to get it to work? 

    Probably... but make sure.
