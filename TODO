DONE:

TODO:

    ------------------------------

    Move all display related stuff into render.cpp so GLFW is only included there

    ------------------------------

    What is the next step? The cube render is here, but now we need to hook up the simulation and camera

    Where does this live?

    Camera could be an entity type but that seems overkill.

    Especially seeing as right now the camera is completely cosmetic.

    ------------------------------

    Hook up to input and so on.

    When bringing across input try to grab immediately key state from keyboard, don't drive it from up/down events

    Get the client to the point where it is running a basic singleplayer demo.

    ------------------------------

    Remove the simulation from the client and run it in the server

    Bring in enough networking to send packets between client and server (network.h)

    Send input across to server, using redundancy encoding for lost commands (eg. acks)

    Setup response packet from server -> client containing snapshot.

    Goal is to setup a pure client/server system (with latency here) before implementing client side prediction.

    Take time to get the jitter buffer for inputs and interpolation buffer working before going further.
