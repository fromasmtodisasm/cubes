DONE:

    Try to get the server running on my linode box.

    I should be able to control firewall rules here and get it working. I think terminal.com blocks UDP traffic.

    Having trouble installing premake4.

    Upgrading the system

TODO:

    Setup linode ssh key to access. Disable root access by password on linux box.













    ----------------------------------------

    Bring across interpolation delay.

    Implement snapshot packets sent to client.

    Bring across delta encoding stuff from snapshots and interpolation demo.

    -----------------------------------------

    At this point should have pure client/server implementation with RTT baked in.

    Try running this over the internet to the real server instance running on linux.

    Are small adjustments required to get it to work? 

    Probably... but make sure.
