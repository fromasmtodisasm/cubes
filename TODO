DONE:

TODO:

    Add adjustment sequence to input packet.

    Server should track first input for new adjust sequence.

    This way the server can defer measurement of an adjustment until after the inputs
    come back with that adjustment.

    This avoids feedback getting into the measurement!


















    ----------------------------------------

    Bring across interpolation delay.

    Implement snapshot packets sent to client.

    Bring across delta encoding stuff from snapshots and interpolation demo.

    -----------------------------------------

    At this point should have pure client/server implementation with RTT baked in.

    Try running this over the internet to the real server instance running on linux.

    Are small adjustments required to get it to work? 

    Probably... but make sure.
