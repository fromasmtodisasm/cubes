DONE:

TODO:

    ----------------------------------------

    ---------------------------------------

    Move single cube data into snapshot structure

    Implement a buffer on the client of snapshots indexed by tick

    Now bring the code for hermite interpolation back for the cube and smooth it out

    Add code to watch how early the server is delivering snapshots to the client

    If the client needs to slow down or speed up the iterator for interpolation, 
    implement this adjustment slowly over time, eg. +/- x ticks over y seconds.

    Now we have three time streams:

        - interpolated time (most in past)
        - server RTT time (client side prediction rewinds to here)
        - predicted client time (driven by the server telling the client to speed up or slow down)

    ----------------------------------------










    ----------------------------------------

    Bring across interpolation delay.

    Implement snapshot packets sent to client.

    Bring across delta encoding stuff from snapshots and interpolation demo.

    -----------------------------------------

    At this point should have pure client/server implementation with RTT baked in.

    Try running this over the internet to the real server instance running on linux.

    Are small adjustments required to get it to work? 

    Probably... but make sure.
