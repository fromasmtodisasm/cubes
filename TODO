DONE:

TODO:    

    ------------------------------

    Work out how to get the alpha blending and color transition blending working again.

    To do this we'll need the concept of per-entity view data, eg. indexed by entity id.

    ------------------------------

    Should now basically have the same cube simulation going again, but now at 240HZ.

    Stop and evaluate. Is there anything else that should be done and cleaned up before going further?

    ------------------------------

    Remove the simulation from the client and run it in the server

    Bring in enough networking to send packets between client and server (network.h)

    Send input across to server, using redundancy encoding for lost commands (eg. acks)

    Setup response packet from server -> client containing snapshot.

    Goal is to setup a pure client/server system (with latency here) before implementing client side prediction.

    Take time to get the jitter buffer for inputs and interpolation buffer working before going further.
