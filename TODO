DONE:

TODO:

    Hook up player velocity tilt.       // todo: velocity tilt could be enhanced if it is a function of desired strafe vs. actual direction

    Hook up player push bobbing etc.

    Hook up player push/pull on other cubes entities in the world.

    ------------------------------

    Bring across cube simulation and strip it down

    Now bring across shaders and get the basic cube simulation rendering

    Hook up to input and so on.

    Should basically have the cube demo back again at this point.

    Simplify and reduce as much as possible before moving forward.

    Make sure to keep the simulation and game code separate.

    ------------------------------

    Remove the simulation from the client and run it in the server

    Bring in enough networking to send packets between client and server (network.h)

    Send input across to server, using redundancy encoding for lost commands (eg. acks)

    Setup response packet from server -> client containing snapshot.

    Goal is to setup a pure client/server system (with latency here) before implementing client side prediction.
