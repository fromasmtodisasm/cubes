DONE:

TODO:

    Setup premake for the client and server so I can link to stuff

    Bring across enough GLFW to get the display window created and updated

    Get the client main loop working

    Base it around VSYNC

    Make sure the client frame time is sampled immediately after frame swap so there is no variance
