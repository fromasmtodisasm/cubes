DONE:

TODO:

    Setup the client so it also creates a world and updates it with ticks.

    -------------------------------

    Add code to physics manager to grab state from physics objects and update
    cube entities post-physics update.

    ------------------------------

    Hook up the player input to drive the simulation

    When bringing across input try to grab immediately key state from keyboard, don't drive it from up/down events

    Get the client to the point where it is running a basic singleplayer demo.

    ------------------------------

    Remove the simulation from the client and run it in the server

    Bring in enough networking to send packets between client and server (network.h)

    Send input across to server, using redundancy encoding for lost commands (eg. acks)

    Setup response packet from server -> client containing snapshot.

    Goal is to setup a pure client/server system (with latency here) before implementing client side prediction.

    Take time to get the jitter buffer for inputs and interpolation buffer working before going further.
