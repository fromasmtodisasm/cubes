DONE:

TODO:    

    Clean up synchronization code. Separate synchronization packets from input/snapshot packets.

    Design code for client to speed up and slow down.

    Design code to detect if too far ahead or too far behind and tell the client to reconnect.

    Implement connect with connect sequence that increases so we can distinguish a connection 
    request for a reconnect from repeated packets for the same session.

    This way I can avoid having complicated resynchronization code while remaining connected.

    Client just reconnects and resynchronizes.

    -----------------------------------------

    Bring across interpolation delay.

    Implement snapshot packets sent to client.

    Bring across delta encoding stuff from snapshots and interpolation demo.

    -----------------------------------------

    At this point should have pure client/server implementation with RTT baked in.

    Try running this over the internet to the real server instance running on linux.

    Are small adjustments required to get it to work? 

    Probably... but make sure.
