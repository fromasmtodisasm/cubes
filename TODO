DONE:

TODO:    

    Try this code running on the linux server. Going to need to upgrade the instance type to large.

    What is the result? Does it still deliver inputs reliably ahead after initial sync?

    -----------------------------------------

    Bring across interpolation delay.

    Implement snapshot packets sent to client.

    Bring across delta encoding stuff from snapshots and interpolation demo.

    -----------------------------------------

    At this point should have pure client/server implementation with RTT baked in.

    Try running this over the internet to the real server instance running on linux.

    Are small adjustments required to get it to work? 

    Probably... but make sure.
