DONE:

    Sketch out initial render.h

TODO:

    Plan out what to bring across

    I want the rendering stuff from cubes.h

    I need the shader manager

    shader manager require core::hash

    core::hash depends on allocator

    Seems like I need to bring across a bunch of low-level core stuff to support the render

    ------------------------------

    Hook up to input and so on.

    When bringing across input try to grab immediately key state from keyboard, don't drive it from up/down events

    Get the client to the point where it is running a basic singleplayer demo.

    ------------------------------

    Remove the simulation from the client and run it in the server

    Bring in enough networking to send packets between client and server (network.h)

    Send input across to server, using redundancy encoding for lost commands (eg. acks)

    Setup response packet from server -> client containing snapshot.

    Goal is to setup a pure client/server system (with latency here) before implementing client side prediction.

    Take time to get the jitter buffer for inputs and interpolation buffer working before going further.
