DONE:

TODO:

    ------------------------------

    Bring across the game code into game.h. This is the code that takes player input and applies
    forces and so on to cubes. Structure this such that it is easily called within the context
    of client side prediction rollback.

    Ensure that game code doesn't talk to ODE directly. goes through physics.h

    ------------------------------

    Bring across cube simulation and strip it down

    Now bring across shaders and get the basic cube simulation rendering

    Hook up to input and so on.

    Should basically have the cube demo back again at this point.

    Simplify and reduce as much as possible before moving forward.

    Make sure to keep the simulation and game code separate.

    ------------------------------

    Remove the simulation from the client and run it in the server

    Bring in enough networking to send packets between client and server (network.h)

    Send input across to server, using redundancy encoding for lost commands (eg. acks)

    Setup response packet from server -> client containing snapshot.

    Goal is to setup a pure client/server system (with latency here) before implementing client side prediction.
