DONE:

TODO:    

    -----------------------------------------

    Implement sliding window of inputs in client.

    Start encoding inputs up to maximum input

    -----------------------------------------

    On the server decode these inputs and add to sliding window.

    -----------------------------------------

    On the server now deliver detect late inputs. 

    If an input is not there from a client when the server needs to simulate that tick,
    print out a warning and bump up a counter.

    If the client delivers too many late inputs in one second return to synchronizing state.

    -----------------------------------------

    Bring across interpolation delay.

    Implement snapshot packets sent to client.

    Bring across delta encoding stuff from snapshots and interpolation demo.

    -----------------------------------------

    At this point should have pure client/server implementation with RTT baked in.

    Try running this over the internet to the real server instance running on linux.

    Are small adjustments required to get it to work? 

    Probably... but make sure.
