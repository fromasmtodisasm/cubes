TODO:    

    ------------------------------

    Bring across enough networking (network.h) for the server to listen on UDP ports.

    Client should connect, get back response + token it should use for rest of communications.

    Design connection protocol so client can use token to request a restart if at any point
    it does not follow the server protocol, eg. server can just say, hey you should reconnect
    to me, or client can initiate reconnect and it should always work.

    Connection should have a period where the client sends data to the server, and the 
    server replies with a block of data to the client.

    While doing this the client should measure QoS to the server and synchronize time.

    Hitching during loading are not allowed because they throw off the time synchronization.
